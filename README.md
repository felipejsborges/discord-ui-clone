	<h1>Discord UI Clone ðŸŽ§</h1>
</div>

### What is it? ðŸš€
This is a clone of the interface of the discord app. I created it to practice [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

### See how it looks

### What is the next step?
- Now, I'm going to create an API in order to make it more dynamic. Besides to practice Node.js. In few days, come back here to see the final result.
